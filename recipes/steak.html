<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For all you beef lovers! Wanna learn how to cook steak like
    a true chef? Here's how!
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Thickish cut steak </strong>– no more than 2.5cm/1″ thick, 
            because we want to cook this entirely on the stove 
            (thicker cuts need to be finished in the oven). 
            <strong>Ideal steaks:</strong> boneless rib eye / scotch fillet, 
            porterhouse / New York, T-bone. <strong>Grade:</strong> takes high 
            quality steak over the top amazing, really elevates economical steak.
        </li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Fresh thyme</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bring to room temp!</strong> This makes an amazing difference to cooking 
            through evenly rather than ending up with a thick 
            overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked 
            to your liking</li>
        <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> and season the steak generously with salt and pepper
             – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about 
             great steaks</li>
        <li>Get your skillet <strong>SMOKING HOT</strong> before putting the steak in 
            – again, for the crust</li>
        <li><strong>WARNING:</strong> The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, 
            so stand back!</li>
        <li>Take the steak off the stove <strong>BEFORE your desired internal temperature</strong> 
            (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue 
            to rise as it rests; and</li>
        <li><strong>REST</strong> your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices 
            back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any
             protein you cook hard and fast!</li>
    </ol>
